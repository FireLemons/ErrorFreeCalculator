A new take on the classic calculator. On a typical calculator a user is allowed to type `+++` and `tan()` and is able to send the erroneous expression for evalutaion. ErrorFreeCalculator was built to make entering some erroneous expressions impossible by disabling buttons duing the entering of an expression.
